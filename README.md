Password Table
!The application is written in Russian but I will translate it into english!

The application is created for saving passwords for diffirent websites and services. 
During the work of the application you can easily put in new information, add new rows, columns, change size of the rows and columns and change settings according to your wish.
The most important function is the coding of the personel data. After first oppening of the .exe file of the application and closing the table. It creates a new directory.
The .exe file moves itself into a directory called PasswordTable and creates a .txt file named TableMainForm which contains encoded data from the table and saved settings.
The data is encoded using a 6 digit number through changing the order of symbols and adding new ones.
You can also export data from one device to another buy saving an export file and remembering the password. Then you need to open application on the new device, import the file and enter the password.
Both settings and data should be saved. Column headers and Service's names are not encoded, because they are repetetive and may give out the way in which the app encodes data.

The application was created using WindowsForms and language C#.
